ansiutils is a collection of utilities designed to make working with ANSI art
a little easier, and includes: 

  * tdftool  - a tool for rendering "TheDraw" (TDF) fonts to the terminal, either
               in CP437 or UTF-8 format

  * ansiread - an ANSI framebuffer that can render ANSI art files and output them 
               either with attribute compression or without. 

  * ansitext - a simple tool for generating text with embedded ANSI attributes, eg. 
               colors, underline, bold etc. 

ansiutils is a work in progress, so there are still many bugs waiting to be squashed
and several planned features that are still missing.
